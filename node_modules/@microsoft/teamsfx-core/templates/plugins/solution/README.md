# More Information

You have a new Teams project scaffolded! To understand more about the structure of the project, you can read the readme files listed below to get further information.

Microsoft Teams apps bring key information, common tools, and trusted processes to where people increasingly gather, learn, and work.Apps are how you extend Teams to fit your needs. Create something brand new for Teams or integrate an existing app.

There are multiple ways to extend Teams, so every app is unique. Some only have one capability, while others have more than one feature to give users various options. For example, your app can display data in a central location, that is, the tab and present that same information through a conversational interface, that is, the bot.
